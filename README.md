## Hill Cipher
Hill cypher is a polygraphic substitution cypher.
A number modulo 26 is assigned to each letter.
The basic scheme A = 0, B = 1,..., Z = 25 is frequently employed, but it is not a requirement of the encryption.
Each block of n letters (considered an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible nxn matrix against modulus 26 to encrypt a message.
Each block is multiplied by the inverse of the encryption matrix to decrypt the message.

## AES Algorithm

## RSA Cipher
[Code Link](https://github.com/SourajitaDewasi/Cryptography/blob/main/RSA%20Cipher.cpp)

It was devised by three scientists Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. It is based on Factorization Problem where number of bits must be atleast 1024 for a secured RSA.
In the solution there has been the use of a small prime integer.

## Elgamal Cipher
[Code Link](https://github.com/SourajitaDewasi/Cryptography/blob/main/ELgamal%20Crypto%20System.cpp)

ElGamal cryptosystem is a cryptography algorithm that secures communication between two systems by utilising public and private key principles.
It's an asymmetric algorithm in which public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt information.
The client uses the public key to encrypt the message, and the message may be decrypted using the private key on the server end.
Because the keys are incredibly difficult to guess, this is considered an efficient approach for encryption and decryption.
